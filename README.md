# Custom Calendar Background
#### A Chrome extension for styling Google calendar.

This is the code behind the chrome extension [Custom Calendar Background](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-calendar-backgroun/acjecbgflnhmeldadcbblhfdimhifpki?hl=en). If you haven't yet, install it using by clicking that link!

The extension includes a few features:
* Set a background, either a single color, a single image, or twelve images that change each month.
* Select between a light and dark overlap to improve text visibility.

_Note: Google Calendar have since added light & dark modes.  
This extension will eventually read from that setting, but in the meantime, please keep both aligned.  
Some things may look weird if the extension is in light mode and google calendar is in dark mode, or vice-versa._
